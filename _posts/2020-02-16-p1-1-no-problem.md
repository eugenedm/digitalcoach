Many years ago when I had an agency I coached a client of mine named Hector. 

I could see that he was getting impatient. But so was I! What bothered me was that we both were clueless where we were going. After achieving some successes, there were no new goals. And that was the biggest mistake!

We had a heated conversation and I was kinda losing  my cool. I said, "I can help you get anything you want but first, you have to tell me what that is!"

It's simple. But simple doesn't always mean easy. 

I will quote Alice in Wonderland. It's right on it. This is so critical, you can either make it big in coaching or destroy your business.

"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don’t much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn’t matter which way you go," said the Cat.
"--so long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation.
"Oh, you’re sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." --Chapter 6, Pig and Pepper

Don't be like Alice! If you will wonder around and waste your time "walking" or working without any direction you will get to the neverland.
