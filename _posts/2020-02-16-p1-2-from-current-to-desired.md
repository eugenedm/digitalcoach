You are in the business of transforming people's lives. You are the merchant of their confidence and their ability.


You need to transform their life from the unaccomplished self to successful self.

And your role is very important in their life, because without you this transformation wouldn't be possible.

You don't have to be a hero, but you have to be their guide.

How can you be a guide, you might ask, if you don't know what they want to achieve? 

Simply ask.

But before asking them just future pace them with their own imagination.

Start with this:

"Imagine yourself now and yourself in one year from now. Two dots. Point A and point B." 

And ask the magic question:

"What has to have happened in your life so you feel great about  achieving your dream goals?"

You are that guide in the middle between point and A and point B.
