You are in the business of transforming people's lives. You are the merchant of their confidence and their ability.


You need to transform their life from the unaccomplished self to successful self.

And your role is very important in their life, because without you this transformation wouldn't be possible.

You don't have to be a hero, but you have to be their guide.

How can you be a guide, you might ask, if you don't know what they want to achieve? 

Simply ask.

But before asking them just future pace them with their own imagination.

Start with this:

"Imagine one year passes. And, imagine you are one year older and smarter. 
   
And so I meet the older you and we have a conversation... And so I ask this question...

What has happened in your life already that makes you so happy with your new results???"

We are talking to them in the future because we need to know their goals and vision for the next year. 

And I believe it is the only way to make them happy about the desired outcome. They will simply tell you. It works beautifully. 

And if you want to ask this question from the present time, you can say this:

"What has to have happened in your life so you feel great about  achieving your dream goals?"

You are that guide in the middle between point A and point B. 

And by asking the right questions you will virtually know everything what needs to be done for your coaching client.
