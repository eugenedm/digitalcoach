Coaching without a brand is like a fisherman trying to catch a fish wihhout a fishing rod.

You need a following to listen to you, to get inspired by you and to buy from you.

No brand - no people. with the exception of ads. But ads could be very expensive if you are starting.

A few years ago I wrote the whole book about how to build your personal brand. The book is called  Influencer Secrets and you can get it here. [Link]  on this subject.
